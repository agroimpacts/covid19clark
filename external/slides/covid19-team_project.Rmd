## COVID-19 Summary

* COVID-19 derives from a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 and tends to spread through saliva droplets when a person coughs or through nose discharge when a person sneezes.

* Most peope with the virus will experience respiratory illness and recover without hospitalization but it more seriously affects older adults and people with underlying medical condiditons. 

* There are currently over 1 million confirmed cases in the United States and over 65,000 deaths. 

* In Massachusetts there are over 65,000 confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths.

---
## COVID19clark Package
* Project was based on "COVID19clark" R package, primarily assembled and developed 
by Dr. Lyndon Estes.

* Package is adapted from Rami Krispin's "coronavirus" R package 
(https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) and data is gathered from Johns 
Hopkins University COVID-19 data repository 
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/).
  * Rami's package was used to create this data dashboard of COVID-19 cases: 
  https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/

* The COVID19clark package summarizes the COVID-19 data from JHU and maps its 
severity in the northeastern United States and graphs the amount of cases and deaths.

## Shiny

#### Summary

* Shiny is a free R package that allows the user to create interactice web 
applications. 

* The current version of Shiny is 1.4.0.2

* No Javascript is required for usage and can use only web mapping platforms
such as Leaflet and Mapbox.

* Can be downloaded using CRAN or Github.

* Can be published onto R Studio's designated Shiny App web server and can be 
treated as a web application.

## Shiny 

#### Setup

To download using CRAN, use the following code chunk:

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("shiny")
 
```

To download from Github, use the following code chunk:

```{r eval=FALSE}

devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny")
 
```

## Shiny

#### Layout

To create a basic app with Shiny use the following code chunk:

Example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(
    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                  label = "Number of bins:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30)
    ),
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      # Output: Histogram ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
    )
  )
)
```

---
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({

    x    <- faithful$waiting
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = "#75AADB", border = "white",
         xlab = "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)",
         main = "Histogram of waiting times")
    })
}
# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

* This example Shiny app creates an interactive page where you can change the
slider for how many bins there are in the random normal distribution bar chart.

* The app consists of a UI function and a Server function.
  * "The user interface (ui) object controls the layout and appearance of your 
  app." (from https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)
  * "The server function contains the instructions that your computer needs to 
  build your app." (from https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)
  * "Finally the shinyApp function creates Shiny app objects from an explicit 
  UI/server pair."  from https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)

## Plotly

#### Summary

* Plotly is a free R package that can be used to create interactive maps with 
ggplot2 graphs and custom interfaces using the open source JavaScript graphic 
library (plotly.js).

* The current version of Plotly is 4.9.2.1 and was released on April 4th, 2020.

* It can be downloaded using CRAN or Github and uses htmlwidgets to create 
interactive dashboards.

## Plotly

#### Setup

To download using CRAN, use the following code chunk:

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("plotly")
 
```


To download from Github, use the following code chunk:

```{r eval=FALSE}

devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
 
```


---

## Plotly

#### Layout


To create a basic chart with Plotly use the following code chunk:


```{r eval=FALSE}

library(plotly)
fig <- plot_ly(us_cases_daily, x = ~x, color = ~state)
fig

```

* The library() function loads the Plotly package. 

* The first argument in the plot_ly() function will be your data in data frame 
form, the second argument will be the x coordinate/longitude of your data, and 
the third argumet will change the color of your chart based on state names in 
the data frame. 

* Other options not shown in the code chunk above, include changing the y 
coordinate/latitude of your data, changing the color of your chart, changing the 
type of your chart, changing the symbol of your chart, among others.
