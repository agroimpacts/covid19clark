#### Layout


To create a basic chart with Plotly use the following code chunk:


```{r eval=FALSE}

library(plotly)
fig <- plot_ly(us_cases_daily, x = ~x, color = ~state)
fig

```

* The library() function loads the Plotly package. 

* The first argument in the plot_ly() function will be your data in data frame form, the second argument will be the x coordinate/longitude of your data, and the third argumet will change the color of your chart based on state names in the data frame. 

* Other options not shown in the code chunk above, include changing the y coordinate/latitude of your data, changing the color of your chart, changing the type of your chart, changing the symbol of your chart, among others.
